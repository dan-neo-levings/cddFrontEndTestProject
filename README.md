# cddFrontEndTestProject

For this project I used the bare minumum in terms of libraries. Only jQuery and SASS has been used.

The main challenged seemed to be deciding on how to accomplish the task, and looking to see how much creativity I could put in without the project becoming clunky and overpopulated with madness.

I achieved everything I wanted to do, however in the end I would of liked to create a small game of some sorts!
